# Gauss Elimination
Module to find the scaled matrix of the given one with the gauss algorithm

## TODO 
- [x] integer management
- [x] fractions management
- [ ] floating point decimals managment
- [ ] inverted matrix scaling (Gauss-Jordan)
- [ ] linear systems resolution (math unknowns)

# Determinant calculation
Module that evaluates determinant based on a scaled matrix (reduced with the Gauss Algorithm)

# TODO
- [x] calculate determinant of a scaled matrix
- [ ] calculate determinant with Laplace's method
